-Question 1: In order to make a 7 segment display like the one in part B I would have each segment be seperate AND gate with its own structure behind it, meaning each is a seperate binary ouput. I would take each decimal number and convert it into binary to show which switches would be switched on to represent that number, and compare when the serperate 7 output gates need to be on or off. Then I would make a truth table to see the structure that would be required behind the 7 output gates.

-Question 2: I think the random number generator is similar to an R-S latch, but there is only one input going to all the gates. The gates are grouped into pairs of AND and NAND gates that feed into eachother. This means that depending on which gate receives the voltage first deteremines the state of the output. There would be a number of these groupings depending on how many binary bits the biggeest number generated is.

-Question 3: Most circuits and random functions in software are not truly random, but are psuedo-random and thus are close enough to being random that the it's not significant. The randomness in how I think the random circuit is made comes from the faultiness in timing of voltages, so because the wires and circuits are not 100% perfect one gate might be powered before another and thus making the output change each time.
