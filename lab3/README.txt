LEARNING

<<Describe what you learned, what was surprising, what worked well and what did not.>>

ISSUES

<<Discuss issues you had building the circuit.>>

DEBUGGING

<<Describe what you added to each module to make debugging easier.>>

Register: I started with one register and added one switch and an LED to test. When that worked I copied the register and added switches for each bit register and LEDs.
Operands: I added 4 switches and 8 LEDS. The switches were for the user inputs and the first 4 LEDs were to show the switches data, while the other 4 LEDs were for the output data.
Mux: I added 8 switches and 8 LEDs for the user input and register input bits, then I added 4 LEDs at the end to show which route was selected.
At the End: I kept the testing LEDS for the above components, while taking out the switches. I also added 4 LEDs for the user input, so that I didn't have to translate hex into binary. I then added 4 LEDs at on the register 7 segment display.
