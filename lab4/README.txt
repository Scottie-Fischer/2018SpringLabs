LEARNING

<<Describe what you learned, what was surprising, what worked well and what did not.>>
I learned the overall structure and syntax of loops and if-else statements. I also learned how the null terminator on ascii strings works, and when to use and not use them as I had messed around with it to see if I could make my program more efficient with the string outputs. I also learned the difference between jumping and branching. I learned how and which conditional branch functions to use as I used these in the if-else blocks. Lastly, I learned how to store a remainder number with division instead of making a whole mod function.
